    "## What Is Networking?\n",
    "Networking is how you connect computers around the world and allow them to communicate with one another. In this trail, you\u2019ve already seen a few examples of networking. One is the AWS global infrastructure. AWS has created a network of resources using data centers, Availability Zones, and Regions."
