    "If you run your code on Amazon EC2, AWS is responsible for the physical hardware and you are responsible for the logical controls, such as guest operating system, security and patching, networking, security, and scaling. If you run your code in containers on Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, AWS is responsible for more of the container management, such as deploying containers across EC2 instances and managing the container cluster. However, when running ECS and EKS on EC2, you are still responsible for maintaining the underlying EC2 instances. If you want to deploy your workloads and applications without having to manage any EC2 instances, you can do that on AWS with *serverless* compute."

Fargate supports both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS architecture and provides workload isolation and improved security by design.\n",

Having native integration with Amazon VPC allows you to launch Fargate containers inside your network and control connectivity to your applications."

    "- You create the code from scratch.\n",
    "- You use a blueprint that AWS provides.\n",
    "- You use same code from the AWS Serverless Application Repository, a resource that contains sample applications, such as “hello world” code, Amazon Alexa Skill sample code, image resizing code, video encoding, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create your Lambda function, you specify the runtime you want your code to run in. There are built-in runtimes such as Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Java, .NET Core, or you can implement your Lambda functions to run on a custom runtime.The configuration of a Lambda function consists of information that describes how the function should run. In the configuration, you specify network placement, environment variables, memory, invocation type, permission sets, and other configurations. To dive deeper into these configurations, check out the resources section of this unit. Triggers describe when the Lambda function should run.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trigger integrates your Lambda function with other AWS services, enabling you to run your Lambda function in response to certain API calls that occur in your AWS account. This makes you quicker to respond to events in your console without having to perform manual actions. All you need is the what, how, and when of a Lambda function to have functional compute capacity that runs only when you need it to. Amazon’s CTO, Werner Vogels, says, “No server is easier to manage than no server.” This quote summarizes the convenience you can have when running serverless solutions, like AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next unit, you apply all the information you’ve learned about Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, and AWS Fargate and learn the use cases for each service."

    "The AWS Lambda function handler is the method in your function code that processes events. When your function is invoked, Lambda runs the handler method.

    "- the name of the Python handler function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function handler can be any name; however, the default on the Lambda console is `lambda_function.lambda_handler`. This name reflects the function name as `lambda_handler`, and the file where the handler code is stored in *lambda_function.py*. If you choose a different name for your function handler on the Lambda console, you must update the name on the **Runtime settings** pane."

    "## Billing Granularity\n",
    "AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, and you pay only for what you use. You are charged for the number of times your code is triggered (requests) and for the time your code executes, rounded up to the nearest 1ms (duration). AWS rounds up duration to the nearest millisecond with no minimum execution time. With this pricing, it can be very cost effective to run functions whose execution time is very low, such as functions with durations under 100ms or low latency APIs.
