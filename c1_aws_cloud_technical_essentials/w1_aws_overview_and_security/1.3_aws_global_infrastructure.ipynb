    "## Choose The Right AWS Region\n",
    "Consider four main aspects when deciding which AWS Region to host your applications and workloads: latency, price, service availability, and compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency.**\u00a0If your application is sensitive to latency, choose a Region that is close to your user base. This helps prevent long wait times for your customers. Synchronous applications such as gaming, telephony, WebSockets, and IoT are significantly affected by higher latency, but even asynchronous workloads, such as ecommerce applications, can suffer from an impact on user connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price.**\u00a0Due to the local economy and the physical nature of operating data centers, prices may vary from one Region to another. The pricing in a Region can be impacted by internet connectivity, prices of imported pieces of equipment, customs, real estate, and more. Instead of charging a flat rate worldwide, AWS charges based on the financial factors specific to the location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Service availability.**\u00a0Some services may not be available in some Regions. The AWS documentation provides a table containing the Regions and the available services within each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data compliance.**\u00a0Enterprise companies often need to comply with regulations that require customer data to be stored in a specific geographic territory. If applicable, you should choose a Region that meets your compliance requirements."

Since they\u2019re located inside Regions, they can be addressed by appending a letter to the end of the Region code name. For example:\n",

    "## Scope AWS Services\n",
    "Depending on the AWS Service you use, your resources are either deployed at the AZ, Region, or Global level. Each service is different, so you need to understand how the scope of a service may affect your application architecture. When you operate a Region-scoped service, you only need to select the Region you want to use. If you are not asked to specify an individual AZ to deploy the service in, this is an indicator that the service operates on a Region-scope level. For region-scoped services, AWS automatically performs actions to increase data durability and availability. On the other hand, some services ask you to specify an AZ. With these services, you are often responsible for increasing the data durability and high availability of these resources."

    "## Maintain Resiliency\n",
    "To keep your application available, you need to maintain high availability and resiliency. A well-known best practice for cloud architecture is to use Region-scoped, managed services. These services come with availability and resiliency built in. When that is not possible, make sure the workload is replicated across multiple AZs. At a minimum, you should use two AZs. If one entire AZ fails, your application will have infrastructure up and running in at least a second AZ to take over the traffic.\n",
