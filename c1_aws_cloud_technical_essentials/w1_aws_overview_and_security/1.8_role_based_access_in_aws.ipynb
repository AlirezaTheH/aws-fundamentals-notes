    "Maintaining roles is easier than maintaining users. When you assume a role, IAM dynamically provides temporary credentials that expire after a defined period of time, between 15 minutes and 36 hours. Users, on the other hand, have long-term credentials in the form of user name and password combinations or a set of access keys. User access keys only expire when you or the admin of your account rotates these keys. User login credentials expire if you have applied a password policy to your account that forces users to rotate their passwords."

    "## Consider Using An Identity Provider\n",
    "If you decide to make your cat photo application into a business and begin to have more than a handful of people working on it, consider managing employee identity information through an identity provider (IdP). Using an IdP, whether it be an\u00a0AWS service such as AWS IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS Single Sign-On) or\u00a0a third-party identity provider, provides you a single source of truth for all identities in your organization.You no longer have to create separate IAM users in AWS. You can instead use IAM roles to provide permissions to identities that are federated from your IdP. For example, you have an employee, Martha, that has access to multiple AWS accounts. Instead of creating and managing multiple IAM users named Martha in each of those AWS accounts, you can manage Martha in your company\u2019s IdP. If Martha moves within the company or leaves the company, Martha can be updated in the IdP, rather than in every AWS account you have."

    "If you have an organization that spans many employees and multiple AWS accounts, you may want your employees to sign in with a single credential.AWS IAM Identity Center is an IdP that lets your users sign in to a user portal with a single set of credentials. It then provides them access to all their assigned accounts and applications in one central location.AWS IAM Identity Center is similar to IAM, in that it offers a directory where you can create users, organize them in groups, and set permissions across those groups, and grant access to AWS resources. However, AWS IAM Identity Center has some advantages over IAM. For example, if you\u2019re using a third-party IdP, you can sync your users and groups to AWS IAM Identity Center.This removes the burden of having to re-create users that already exist elsewhere, and it enables you to manage those users from your IdP. More importantly, AWS IAM Identity Center\u00a0separates the duties between your IdP and AWS, ensuring that your cloud access management is not inside or dependent on your IdP."
