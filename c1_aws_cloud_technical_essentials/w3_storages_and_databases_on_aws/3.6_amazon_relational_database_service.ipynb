    "## What Is Amazon RDS?\n",
    "Amazon RDS enables you to create and manage relational databases in the cloud without the operational burden of traditional database management. For example, if you sell healthcare equipment and your goal is to be the number-one seller in the Pacific Northwest, building out a database doesn\u2019t directly help you achieve that goal though having a database is necessary to achieve the goal. Amazon RDS helps you offload some of this unrelated work of creating and managing a database. You can focus on the tasks that differentiate your application, instead of infrastructure-related tasks such as provisioning, patching, scaling, and restoring. Amazon RDS supports most of the popular relational database management systems, ranging from commercial options, open source options, and even an AWS-specific option. Here are the supported Amazon RDS engines.\n",
    "- **Commercial:** Oracle, SQL Server\n",
    "- **Open Source:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB\n",
    "- **Cloud Native:** Amazon Aurora\n",

    "## Understand DB Instances\n",
    "Just like the databases that you would build and manage yourself, Amazon RDS is built off of compute and storage. The compute portion is called the DB (database) instance, which runs the database engine. Depending on the engine of the DB instance you choose, the engine will have different supported features and configurations. A DB instance can contain multiple databases with the same engine, and each database can contain multiple tables. Underneath the DB instance is an EC2 instance. However, this instance is managed through the Amazon RDS console instead of the Amazon EC2 console. When you create your DB instance, you choose the instance type and size. Amazon RDS supports three instance families.\n",
    "- **Standard**, which include general-purpose instances\n",
    "- **Memory Optimized**, which are optimized for memory-intensive applications\n",
    "- **Burstable Performance**, which provides a baseline performance level, with the ability to burst to full CPU usage.\n",

You can find more information about the DB instance types in the resources section of this unit. Much like a regular EC2 instance, the DB instance uses Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes as its storage layer. You can choose between three types of EBS volume storage.\n",

This ensures your DB instance, and the cat data inside of it, can only be reached by the app backend. Access to the DB instance can be further restricted by using network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups. With these firewalls, you can control, at a granular level, what type of traffic you want to allow into your database. Using these controls provide layers of security for your infrastructure. It reinforces that only the backend instances have access to the database."

Typically, you want to set these windows during a time when your database experiences little activity because it can cause increased latency and downtime.\n",

You might ask yourself, \u201cWhy set automated backups for 0 days?\u201d The 0 days setting actually disables automatic backups from happening.

    "## Get Redundancy with Amazon RDS Multi-AZ\n",
    "When you enable Amazon RDS Multi-AZ, Amazon RDS creates a redundant copy of your database in another AZ. You end up with two copies of your database: a primary copy in a subnet in one AZ and a standby copy in a subnet in a second AZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary copy of your database provides access to your data so that applications can query and display that information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the primary copy is synchronously replicated to the standby copy. The standby copy is not considered an active database, and does not get queried by applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve availability, Amazon RDS Multi-AZ ensures that you have two copies of your database running and that one of them is in the primary role. If there\u2019s an availability issue, such as the primary database losing connectivity, Amazon RDS triggers an automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a DB instance, a domain name system (DNS) name is provided. AWS uses that DNS name to failover to the standby database. In an automatic failover, the standby database is promoted to the primary role and queries are redirected to the new primary database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that you don\u2019t lose Multi-AZ configuration, a new standby database is created by either:\n",
    "- Demoting the previous primary to standby if it\u2019s still up and running\n",
    "- Or standing up a new standby DB instance\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you can select multiple subnets for an Amazon RDS database is because of the Multi-AZ configuration. You\u2019ll want to ensure that you have used subnets in different AZs for your primary and standby copies."
