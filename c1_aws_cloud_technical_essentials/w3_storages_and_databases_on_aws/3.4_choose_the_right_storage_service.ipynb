    "## Amazon EC2 Instance Store\n",
    "Instance store is ephemeral block storage. This is preconfigured storage that exists on the same physical server that hosts the EC2 instance and cannot be detached from Amazon EC2. You can think of it as a built-in drive for your EC2 instance. Instance store is generally well-suited for temporary storage of information that is constantly changing, such as buffers, caches, and scratch data. It is not meant for data that is persistent or long-lasting. If you need persistent long-term block storage that can be detached from Amazon EC2 and provide you more management flexibility, such as increasing volume size or creating snapshots, then you should use Amazon EBS."

    "- Performance depends on IOPS (input/output operations per second).\n",
    "- Ideal for transactional workloads such as databases and boot volumes.\n",

    "HDD-backed volumes have the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Performance depends on MB/s.\n",
