    "Choosing a database used to be a straightforward decision. There were only a few options to choose from. In the past, you likely considered a few vendors and then inevitably chose one for all of your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses often selected the database technology they were going to use, even before they fully understood their use case. Since the 1970s, the database most commonly selected by businesses was a **relational database**."

    "## What Is A Relational Database?\n",
    "A relational database organizes data into tables. Data in one table can be linked to data in other tables to create relationships (hence, the relational part of the name).\n",
    "\n",
    "A table stores data in rows and columns. A row, often called a record, contains all information about a specific entry. Columns describe attributes of that entry. Here’s an example of three tables in a relational database.\n",

    "This shows a table for books, a table for sales, and a table for authors. In the books table, each row includes the book ISBN, the title, the author, and the format. Each of these attributes is stored in its own column. The books table has something in common with the other two tables: the author attribute. That common column creates a relationship between the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tables, rows, columns, and relationships between them is referred to as a **logical schema**. With relational databases, a schema is fixed. Once the database is operational, it becomes difficult to change the schema. This requires most of the data modeling to be done upfront before the database is active."

    "## What Is A Relational Database Management System?\n",
    "A relational database management system (RDBMS) lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Here are some common examples of relational database management systems:\n",
    "- MySQL\n",
    "- PostgresQL\n",
    "- Oracle\n",
    "- SQL server\n",
    "- Amazon Aurora\n",
    "\n",
    "You communicate with most RDBMS by using Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. Here’s an example: `SELECT * FROM table_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This query selects all of the data from a particular table. However, the real power of SQL queries is in creating more complex queries that let you pull data from several tables to piece together patterns and answers to business problems. For example, querying the sales table and the book table together to see sales in relation to an author’s books. This is made possible by a join, which we talk about next."

    "- **Reduced redundancy:** You can store data in one table and reference it from other tables instead of saving the same data in different places.\n",
    "- **Familiarity:** Relational databases have been a popular choice since the 1970s. Due to this popularity, technical professionals often have familiarity and experience with this type of database.\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Relational databases ensure that your data is persisted with high integrity and adheres to the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) principle."

The Shared Responsibility Model distinguishes between AWS’s and the customer’s security responsibility over a service.
