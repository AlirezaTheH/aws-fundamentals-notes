    "## Vertical Scaling\n",
    "If there are too many requests sent to a single active-passive system, the active server will become unavailable and hopefully failover to the passive server. But this doesn’t solve anything. With active-passive, you need vertical scaling. This means increasing the size of the server. With EC2 instances, you select either a larger type or a different instance type. This can only be done while the instance is in a stopped state. In this scenario, the following steps occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stop the passive instance. This doesn’t impact the application since it’s not taking any traffic.\n",
    "2. Change the instance size or type, then start the instance again.\n",
    "3. Shift the traffic to the passive instance, turning it active.\n",
    "4. The last step is to stop, change the size, and start the previous active instance as both instances should match.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the amount of requests reduces, the same operation needs to be done. Even though there aren’t that many steps involved, it’s actually a lot of manual work to do. Another disadvantage is that a server can only scale vertically up to a certain limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that limit is reached, the only option is to create another active-passive system and split the requests and functionalities across them. This could require massive application rewriting.This is where the active-active system can help. When there are too many requests, this system can be scaled horizontally by adding more servers."

It would only be a matter of creating more instances when required and shutting them down when the traffic decreases.\n",

You use **metrics** to keep information about different attributes of your EC2 instance like the CPU percentage. You use **alarms** to specify an action when a threshold is reached. Metrics and alarms are what scaling policies use to know when to act. For example, you set up an alarm that says when the CPU utilization is above 70% across the entire fleet of EC2 instances, trigger a scaling policy to add an EC2 instance.\n",

You can specify a percentage of the group instead of using an amount of EC2 instances, which makes the group grow or shrink more quickly.\n",

    "Once this scaling policy is triggered, it waits a cooldown period before taking any other action. This is important as it takes time for the EC2 instances to start and the CloudWatch alarm may still be triggered while the EC2 instance is booting. For example, you could decide to add an EC2 instance if the CPU utilization across all instances is above 65%. You don’t want to add more instances until that new EC2 instance is accepting traffic.\n",
    "\n",
